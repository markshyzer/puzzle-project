# Description

This is a real-time multi-user application that allows several players to work together to complete a jigsaw-style puzzle. A chat function is also available within each puzzle room, and users may sign in to create their own rooms, or can play in the public room without requiring an account.

## How to Play

To begin, click the puzzle icon to enter the public puzzle room. Alternately, you can create an account or sign in to create a unique puzzle room. Share the puzzle room's URL to add other users. Signed-in users may also view a list of active rooms. To complete the puzzle, click to drag pieces onto the board outline. When a piece has been moved to the correct place on the board it will lock into place.
